This project represents my attempt at the Huddle Landing Page with Curved Sections challenge provided by [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/). The challenge involved creating a visually appealing landing page with curved sections, showcasing information about a fictional product or service.

## Overview

The Huddle Landing Page challenge focused on building an engaging landing page with curved sections. The goal was to create a visually appealing layout that effectively communicates information about the product or service being promoted. The challenge required a responsive design that adapts seamlessly to different screen sizes and devices.

Throughout the project, I strived to understand the design requirements and implemented a responsive layout using HTML and CSS. The objective was to create an attractive landing page that captures the attention of visitors and effectively communicates the key features and benefits of the product or service.
